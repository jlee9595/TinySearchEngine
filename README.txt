README

Simply build my submission by calling make in the lab4 directory (using the Makefile that I have provided inside the directory)

The only potentially ambiguous assumptions that my crawler program makes is that the directory that it writes files to is empty prior to calling it and the target directory ends in a "/"

My program can be run with the following syntax: crawler [seed-url] [target directory] [depth]
example: crawler http://old-www.cs.dartmouth.edu/~cs50/tse/ ./target/ 2
