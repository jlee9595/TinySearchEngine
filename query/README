The only out of the ordinary assumption that my query mkaes is that when the user enters the directory as a paremeter that it ends in a /.

Example of a good input: query index.dat ./target/
Example of bad input: query index.dat ./target

I have included a "target" testing directory and index.dat file in the src folder to be used by the queryengine_test.c file. These files should not be deleted.
In my queryengine_test.c file I test the two functions I have created to aid my main function. Rather than "including" them, I chose to copy and paste them directly into the testing file. 
To use the queryengine_test.c file, call "make test" in the query/src directory.
This testing file tests a couple situations and also tests different inputs into the command line for query.

The QEBATS.sh file simply puts the crawler, indexer, and query together and lets the user test at his leisure at the end.
(Please note, the indexing phase takes around 2 minutes at depth 2 so give it time)
